    <h1 id="welcome">Welcome to<br>Carbon Stock Exchange</h1>
    <div id="full_concept">
        <p id="concept_note1">
            In a restaurant, along with the price of a dish, <b class="highlight">the menu also displays the carbon footprint</b> of
            that specific dish. So that, whenever a customer orders, they are aware of the Green House Gas emissions
            caused by the dish they are about to order. <br><br>
            
            The total amount of carbon foot print of all dishes ordered by all customers in a day, is kept track of. 
            It is added to a <b class="highlight">cumulative carbon footprint counter</b>. The home page will show this counter, 
            and other data visualisations on climate change. <br><br>

            There is a set threshold, and when the cumulative carbon footprint crosses the threshold, the
            price of all the dishes which fall in the highest carbon footprint (cfp) segment increases. 
            <b class="highlight">There by, reducing the demand</b>. Which will subsequently bring down the rate of increase of the
            cumulative cfp of the restaurant. But as a result, the demand for the dishes which fall
            under the lower segment of cfp will also increase, which would then increase their price. And
            eventually the high cfp dishes will come to a nominal price. This cycle will continue till the day
            ends.
        </p>

        <p id="concept_note2"> 
            To add more fun to the whole process, <b class="highlight">random market crashes and influence from external sources</b>
            will also be there, which determine the price of the dishes. Some dishes might be like
            <b class="highlight">elastic commodities</b>, while some might be like <b class="highlight">inelastic commodities</b>. <br><br>

            The idea is not to be biased towards veg dishes. The idea is to add a fun element, an element
            of uncertainty and a simulation of the stock market inside a restaurant. It is still meant to
            serve all dishes, veg and non-veg. It simply makes the customers aware of the pressing issue,
            and how <b class="highlight">food is also a huge contributor</b> towards their carbon footprint. <br><br>

            I also plan to add <b class="highlight">green happy hours</b>, where there is an advantage in consuming low cfp
            dishes, which are not necessarily veg dishes. Upon that if a customer comes using public
            transport or an electric vehicle to come to the restaurant, they get a coupon which can 
            be redeemed inside the restaurant <b class="highlight   ">for a discount</b>.
